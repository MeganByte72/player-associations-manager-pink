Import / Export works with json files so importing and export databases is easy making it very simple 2 share your databases with others importing another persons data base does not simple overwrite everything in your database it will add the player and data associated if you dont have that player and if you do already have that player it will simple update the information associated with that player so you dont have to worry about losing all of your data during import ^-^
